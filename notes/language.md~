### The SAT Language
The SAT Language is currently quite simple.  All tokens should be delimited with whitespace.
The tokens "A", "O", "N" denote the boolean operators "and", "or", and "not", respectively.
All other alphanumeric strings, including those with '_' or '-' in the middle may be used as
variable tokens.  Variables do not need to be declared.  Parentheses may be used as expected.
The operators, in order of precedence, are "not", "and", "or".
