### The SAT Language
The SAT Language is currently quite simple.  All tokens should be delimited with whitespace.
The tokens "A", "O", "N" denote the boolean operators "and", "or", and "not", respectively.
Variable names are the same as those in C.  Variables do not need to be declared.
Parentheses may be used as expected.  The operators, in order of precedence, are "not", "and", "or".
